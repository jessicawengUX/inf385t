## Group Name: The Guinea Pigs

### Project Idea

Our group will do a training resource management system for ammunition and potentially training. For training in the Army, one key aspect is to calculate and resource ammunition requirements in advance. This requires people to go through multiple documents and spend much time looking through different documents and calculating requirements on excel. The goal for our project is for users to type in the number of people participating in a specific training event in which the application would calculate and output the ammunition requirements for that event. Ideally, the users would be able to create accounts and store specific training events along with the ammunition resource needs require for those events.
